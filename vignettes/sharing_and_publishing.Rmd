# 1 Introduction

In the educational and social sciences, it is a common practice to share
research instruments such as questionnaires or tests. For example, the
[Open Test Archive](https://www.testarchiv.eu/en) provides researchers
and practitioners access to a large number of open access instruments.
*aifeducation* assumes AI-based classifiers
should be shareable, similarly to research instruments, to empower
educational and social science researchers and to support the
application of AI for educational purposes. Thus, *aifeducation* aims to
make the sharing process as easy as possible.

For this aim, every object generated with *aifeducation* can be prepared
for publication in a few basic steps. In this vignette, we would like to
show you how to make your AI ready for publication and how to use models
from other persons.

Now we will start with a guide on preparing text embedding models.

# 2 Text Embedding Models

## 2.1 Adding Model Descriptions

Every object of class `TextEmbeddingModel` comes with several methods
allowing you to provide important information for potential users of
your model.

First, every model needs a clear description how it was developed,
modified and how it can be used. You can add a description via the
method `set_model_description`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_model$set_model_description(
  eng=NULL,
  native=NULL,
  abstract_eng=NULL,
  abstract_native=NULL,
  keywords_eng=NULL,
  keywords_native=NULL)
```

This method allows you to provide a description in English and in the
native language of your model to make the distribution of your model
easier. You can write your description in HTML which allows you to
add links to other sources or publications, to add tables or to
highlight important aspects of your model.

**We would like to recommend that you write at least an English
description to allow a wider community to recognize your work**.
Furthermore, your description should include:

-   Which kind of data was used to create the model.
-   How much data was used to create the model.
-   Which steps were performed and which method was used.
-   For which kinds of tasks or materials the model can be used.

With `abstract_eng` and `abstract_native` you can provide a summary of
your description. This is very important if you would like to share your
work on a repository. With `keywords_eng` and `keywords_native` you can
set a vector of keywords which help to find your work with search
engines. We would like to recommend that you at least provide this
information in English.

You can access a model's description by using the method
`get_model_description`

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_model$get_model_description()
```

Besides a description of your work it is necessary to provide
information about other people who were involved in creating a model.
This can be done with the method `set_publication_info`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_model$set_publication_info(
  type,
  authors,
  citation,
  url=NULL)
```

First of all you have to decide the type of information you would like
to add. You have two choices: "developer", and "modifier",
which you set with `type`.

`type="developer"` stores all information about the people involved and
the process of developing the model. If you use a transformer model from
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), the people and their description
of the model should be entered as developers. In all other cases you can
use this type for providing a description of how you developed the
model.

In some cases you might wish to modify an existing model. This might be
the case if you use a transformer model and you adapt the model to a
specific domain or task. In this case you rely on the work of other
people and modify their work. In these cases you can describe your
modifications by setting `type=modifier`.

For every type of person you can add the relevant individuals via
`authors`. Please use the *R*'s function `personList()` for this. With
`citation`you can provide a free text how to cite the work of the
different persons. With `url` you can provide a link to relevant sites
of the model.

You can access the information by using `get_publication_info`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_model$get_publication_info()
```

Finally, you must provide a license for using your model. This can be
done with `set_software_license` and `get_software_license`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_model$set_software_license("GPL-3")
```

Please note, that in most cases the license for your model must be "GPL-3" since
some of the software used to create your model are licensed under "GPL-3". Thus,
derivative work must also be licensed under "GPL-3".

The documentation of your work is not part of the software. Here you can set
other licenses such as Creative Common (CC) or Free Documentation License (FDL).
You can set the license for your documentation by using the method 
'set_documentation_license'.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_model$set_documentation_license("CC BY-SA")
```

Now you are able to share your work. Please remember to save your now
fully described object as described in the following section 2.2.

## 2.2 Saving and Loading

Saving a created text embedding model is very easy by using the
function `save_ai_model`. This function provides a unique interface for all
text embedding models. For saving your work you can pass your model to `model` and
the directory where to save the model to `model_dir`. Please do only pass 
the path of a directory and not the path of a file to this function. Internally
the function creates a new folder in the directory where all files belonging
to a model are stored.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
save_ai_model(
  model=topic_modeling, 
  model_dir="text_embedding_models",
  append_ID=TRUE)

save_ai_model(
  model=global_vector_clusters_modeling, 
  model_dir="text_embedding_models",
  append_ID=TRUE)

save_ai_model(
  model=bert_modeling, 
  model_dir="text_embedding_models",
  append_ID=TRUE)
```

As you can see all three text embedding models are saved within the same
directory named "text_embedding_models". Within this directory the function
creates a unique folder for every model. The name of the folder is created 
by using the models' names. Since the files are stored with
a special structure please do **not** edit the files manually. 

If you want to load your model, just call the function `load_ai_model` and you can continue
using your model.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
topic_modeling<-load_ai_model(
  model_dir="text_embedding_models/topic_model_embedding_ID_DfO25E1Guuaqw7tM")

global_vector_clusters_modeling<-load_ai_model(
  model_dir="text_embedding_models/global_vector_clusters_embedding_ID_5Tu8HFHegIuoW14l")

bert_modeling<-load_ai_model(
  model_dir="text_embedding_models/bert_embedding_ID_CmyAQKtts5RdlLaS")
```

> **Note:** In the case of transformers you can decide which machine learning framework should
be used for applying the model by specifying `ml_framework`. Please do *not* edit
the argument manually. It is recommend that you set your machine learning framework
at the start of a session with `aifeducation_config$set_global_ml_backend()`.

**Please note that you have to add the name of the model to the directory path.**
In our example we have stored three models in the directory "text_embedding_models". Each
model is saved within its own folder. The folder's name is created automatically
with the help of the name of the model. Thus, for loading a model you must specify
which model you want to load by adding the model's name to the directory path as
shown above. 

At this point you may wonder why there is an ID in model's name although you
did not enter an ID on model's creation. The ID is added automatically to ensure
that every model has a unique name. This is important if you would like to share your 
work with other persons. During saving the ID is appended automatically by 
setting `append_ID=TRUE`.

Now you are ready to share your work. Just provide all files within your model
folder. For the BERT model in the example above this would be the folder 
`"text_embedding_models/bert_embedding_ID_CmyAQKtts5RdlLaS"`.

# 3 Classifiers

## 3.1 Adding Model Descriptions

Adding the model description of a classifier is similar to
`TextEmbeddingModel`s. With the methods `set_model_description` and
`get_model_description` you can provide a detailed description
(parameter `eng` and `native`) of your classifier in English and the
native language of your classifier. With `abstract_eng` and
`abstract_native` you can provide the corresponding abstract of your
descriptions while `keywords_eng` and `keywords_native` take a vector
with the corresponding keywords.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_classifier$set_model_description(
eng="This classifier targets the realization of the need for competence from 
  the self-determination theory of motivation by Deci and Ryan in lesson plans 
  and materials. It describes a learner’s need to perceive themselves as capable. 
  In this classifier, the need for competence can take on the values 0 to 2. 
  A value of 0 indicates that the learners have no space in the lesson plan to 
  perceive their own learning progress and that there is no possibility for 
  self-comparison. At level 1, competence growth is made visible implicitly, 
  e.g. by demonstrating the ability to carry out complex exercises or peer 
  control. At level 2, the increase in competence is made explicit by giving 
  each learner insights into their progress towards the competence goal. For 
  example, a comparison between the target vs. actual development towards the 
  learning objectives of the lesson can be made, or the learners receive 
  explicit feedback on their competence growth from the teacher. Self-assessment 
  is also possible. The classifier was trained using 790 lesson plans, 298 
  materials and up to 1,400 textbook tasks. Two people who received coding 
  training were involved in the coding and the inter-coder reliability for the 
  need for competence increased from a dynamic iota value of 0.615 to 0.646 over 
  two rounds of training. The Krippendorffs alpha value, on the other hand, 
  decreased from 0.516 to 0.484. The classifier is suitable for use in all 
  settings in which lesson plans and materials are to be reviewed with regard 
  to their implementation of the need for competence.",
native="Dieser Classifier bewertet Unterrichtsentwürfe und Lernmaterial danach, 
  ob sie das Bedürfnis nach Kompetenzerleben aus der Selbstbestimmungstheorie 
  der Motivation nach Deci und Ryan unterstützen. Das Kompetenzerleben stellt 
  das Bedürfnis dar, sich als wirksam zu erleben. Der Classifer unterteilt es 
  in drei Stufen, wobei 0 bedeutet, dass die Lernenden im Unterrichtsentwurf 
  bzw. Material keinen Raum haben, ihren eigenen Lernfortschritt wahrzunehmen 
  und auch keine Möglichkeit zum Selbstvergleich besteht. Bei einer Ausprägung 
  von 1 wird der Kompetenzzuwachs implizit, also z.B. durch die Durchführung 
  komplexer Übungen oder einer Peer-Kontrolle ermöglicht. Auf Stufe 2 wird der 
  Kompetenzzuwachs explizit aufgezeigt, indem jede:r Lernende einen objektiven 
  Einblick erhält. So kann hier bspw. ein Soll-Ist-Vergleich mit den Lernzielen 
  der Stunde erfolgen oder die Lernenden erhalten dezidiertes Feedback zu ihrem 
  Kompetenzzuwachs durch die Lehrkraft. Auch eine Selbstbewertung ist möglich.
  Der Classifier wurde anhand von 790 Unterrichtsentwürfen, 298 Materialien und 
  bis zu 1400 Schulbuchaufgaben traniert. Es waren an der Kodierung zwei Personen 
  beteiligt, die eine Kodierschulung erhalten haben und die 
  Inter-Coder-Reliabilität für das Kompetenzerleben würde über zwei 
  Trainingsrunden von einem dynamischen Iota-Wert von 0,615 auf 0,646 gesteigert. 
  Der Krippendorffs Alpha-Wert sank hingegen von 0,516 auf 0,484. Er eignet sich 
  zum Einsatz in allen Settings, in denen Unterrichtsentwürfe und Lernmaterial 
  hinsichtlich ihrer Umsetzung des Kompetenzerlebens überprüft werden sollen.",
abstract_eng="This classifier targets the realization of the need for 
  competence from Deci and Ryan’s self-determination theory of motivation in l
  esson plans and materials. It describes a learner’s need to perceive themselves 
  as capable. The variable need for competence is assessed by a scale of 0-2. 
  The classifier was developed using 790 lesson plans, 298 materials and up to 
  1,400 textbook tasks. A coding training was conducted and the inter-coder 
  reliabilities of different measures 
  (i.e. Krippendorff’s Alpha and Dynamic Iota Index) of the individual categories 
  were calculated at different points in time.",
abstract_native="Dieser Classifier bewertet Unterrichtsentwürfe und 
  Lernmaterial danach, ob sie das Bedürfnis nach Kompetenzerleben aus der 
  Selbstbestimmungstheorie der Motivation nach Deci & Ryan unterstützen. Das 
  Kompetenzerleben stellt das Bedürfnis dar, sich als wirksam zu erleben. Der 
  Classifer unterteilt es in drei Stufen und wurde anhand von 790 
  Unterrichtsentwürfen, 298 Materialien und bis zu 1400 Schulbuchaufgaben 
  entwickelt. Es wurden stets Kodierschulungen durchgeführt und die 
  Inter-Coder-Reliabilitäten der einzelnen Kategorien zu verschiedenen 
  Zeitpunkten berechnet.",
keywords_eng=c("Self-determination theory", "motivation", "lesson planning", "business didactics"),
keywords_native=c("Selbstbestimmungstheorie", "Motivation", "Unterrichtsplanung", "Wirtschaftsdidaktik")
```

In the case of a classifier, the description should include:

-   A short reference to the theoretical models that guided the
    development.
-   A clear and detailed description of every single category/class.
-   A short statement where the classifier can be used.
-   A description of the kind and quantity of data used for training.
-   Information on potential bias in the data.
-   If possible, information about the inter-coder-reliability of the
    coding process providing the data.
-   If possible, provide a link to the corresponding text embedding
    model.

Again, you can provide your description in HTML to include tables (e.g.
for reporting the reliability of the initial coding process) or links to
other sources and publications.

**Please do not report the performance values of your classifier in the
description.** These can be accessed directly via
`example_classifier$reliability$test_metric_mean`.

With the methods `set_publication_info` and `get_publication_info` you
can provide the bibliographic information of your classifier.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_classifier$set_publication_info(
  authors,
  citation,
  url=NULL)
```

In contrast to TextEmbeddingModels there are not different types of
author groups.

Finally, you can manage the license for using your classifier via
`set_software_license` and `get_software_license`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_classifier$set_software_license("GPL-3")
```

Similar to TextEmbeddingModels your classifier has to be licensed via "GPL-3" since
some of the software used for creating a classifier applies this license. For the
documentation you can choose between further license since the documentation is 
not part of the software. For setting and receivinf the license you can call
the methods 'set_documentation_license' and 'get_documentation_license'

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example_classifier$set_documentation_license("CC BY-SA")
```

Now you are ready for sharing your classifier. Please remember to save
your changes as described in the following section 3.2.

## 3.2 Saving and Loading

If you have created a classifier, saving and loading is very easy due to
the functions `save_ai_model` and `load_ai_model`. The process
for saving a model is similar to the process for text embedding models. You only have 
to pass the model and a directory path to the function `save_ai_model`.

```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
save_ai_model(
  model=classifier,
  model_dir="classifiers",
  save_format = "keras",
  append_ID = TRUE)
```

In contrast to text embedding models you can specify the additional argument `save_format`
allowing you to choose between `save_format = "keras"`, `save_format = "tf"` and  `save_format = "h5"`.
We recommend to chose `save_format = "keras"` since this is allows to use the classifier
with both 'PyTorch' and 'tensorflow'.

If you would like to load a model you can call the function `load_ai_model`.
```{r, include = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
classifier<-load_ai_model(
  model_dir="classifiers/movie_review_classifier_ID_oWsaNEB7b09A1pPB")
```

> **Note:** In the documentation of the function you find an argument `ml_framework`.
Please do *not* change the argument manually since this argument is controlled 
by the global configuration you have set at the beginning of a session with
`aifeducation_config$set_global_ml_backend()`.

> **Note:** Since the classifier is written with 'keras' using a classifier with
'PyTorch' requires at least 'keras version 3'. In the case your system is not compatible
with 'keras version 3' you can sill use the classifiers with 'tensorflow'.

Similar to text embedding models an ID is added to the name during the creation
of the classifier ensuring a unique name for your model. Thus, you have to specify
the correct folder for loading a classifier.

If you would like to share your classifier with other persons you have to 
provide all files within the folder `"classifiers/movie_review_classifier_ID_oWsaNEB7b09A1pPB"`.
Since all files are stored with a specific structure do **not** change or
edit the files manually.

Please note that you need the `TextEmbeddingModel` that was used for
training in order to predict new data with the classifier. You can
request the name, label, and configuration of that model with
`example_classifier$get_text_embedding_model()$model`. Thus, if you would like to
share your classifier, ensure that you also share the corresponding text
embedding model.

If you would like to apply your classifier to new data, two steps are
necessary. First, you must transform the raw text into a numerical
expression by using *exactly* the same text embedding model that was
used to train your classifier. The resulting object can be passed to the
method `predict` and you will receive the predictions together with an
estimate of certainty for each class/category.

More information can be found in the vignette [02 classification tasks](classification_tasks.html).
